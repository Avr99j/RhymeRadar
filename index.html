              <p class="card-text" id="lyrics-content">There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
                When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
                With a word she can get what she came for
                Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
                There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
                'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
                In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
                Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
                Ooh, it makes me wonder
                Ooh, makes me wonder
                There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
                And my spirit is crying for leaving
                In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
                And the voices of those who stand looking
                Ooh, it makes me wonder
                Ooh, really makes me wonder
                And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
                Then the piper will lead us to reason
                And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
                And the forests will echo with laughter
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
                If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
                It's just a spring clean for the May queen
                Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
                There's still time to change the road you're on
                And it makes me wonder
                Ohh, whoa
                Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
                The piper's calling you to join him
                Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
                Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
                And as we wind on down the road
                Our shadows taller than our soul
                There walks a lady we all know
                Who shines white light and wants to show
                How everything still turns to gold
                And if you listen very hard
                The tune will come to you at last
                When all are one, and one is all
                To be a rock and not to roll
                And she's buying a stairway to Heaven</p>
